The two elderly friends of Alice’s granddad come over to Mum and Dad and Auntie. Len is putting on a deerstalker hat, Jim a flat cap.
Len:Er, Graham – Jim and I thought we’d take your dad off now. Hop on’t bus back up Grenoside.
Jim: Very sorry for your loss, Mrs Little. At least he had a good innings.
Mum: He was seventeen.
Dad: Jim’s on autopilot, that’s all. Don’t worry about it. Listen, don’t go for a minute, I was just about to show everyone something.
Dad goes out towards the hall.
Len: We’re actually having a bit of trouble finding your dad’s hat.
Dad: Oh, um. OK. In the hall?
Mum: It’s over there on the buffet.
The hat is on the buffet table, on top of a plate of sausage rolls.
Len: Alf, did you put your hat on’t sausage rolls, silly bugger?
They go to retrieve Granddad’s hat.
Guest: I thought the flowers were lovely. She’s not been out the house, you know. Two weeks!
Auntie: I mean it’s just SO sad. He was here and now he’s gone.
Uncle: Alright, love. You’ve had one too many sherries, that’s all.
